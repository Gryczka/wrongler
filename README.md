# Wrongler 🚀

> Wrangler with YOLO mode - because sometimes you just gotta ship it

## ⚠️ WARNING: FOR FUN ONLY ⚠️

**This project is called WRONGler for a reason.**

- 🎲 **DO NOT use this for serious/production work**
- 🎪 **This is a fun side project and experimental wrapper**
- 💥 **YOLO deploy is exactly what it sounds like - use at your own risk**
- 🎢 **Automatic deployments on every save can go hilariously wrong**
- 🤡 **No warranties, no guarantees, just pure YOLO energy**

If you're looking for a reliable, production-ready deployment tool, use [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk) directly. If you want to live dangerously and have some fun, welcome aboard! 🎉

---

**Wrongler** is a lightweight wrapper around [Cloudflare's Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk) that adds **YOLO Mode** - automatic redeployment on file changes, inspired by AWS SAM's `sam sync --watch`.

## Installation

Requires Node.js 22.12 or later (current Wrangler needs Node 22).

```bash
# Install wrongler
npm install -g @gryczka/wrongler

# wrongler requires wrangler as a peer dependency
npm install -g wrangler
```

Or use both together:
```bash
npm install -g @gryczka/wrongler wrangler
```

## What is YOLO Mode?

YOLO Mode watches your Worker files and automatically redeploys to Cloudflare's edge on every save. Perfect for rapid development iterations!

### Features

- ✅ **Auto-deploy on save** - 50ms debounce for rapid changes
- ✅ **Smart file watching** - Skips `node_modules`, `.git`, `.wrangler`, `dist` and `build`
- ✅ **Any Wrangler config** - Reads `wrangler.json`, `wrangler.jsonc` (comments and all) or `wrangler.toml`
- ✅ **Condensed output** - Clean, minimal deployment info
- ✅ **Error resilient** - Stays in watch mode even if deployment fails
- ✅ **Graceful shutdown** - Clean exit on Ctrl+C

## Usage

### Basic YOLO Mode
```bash
wrongler deploy --yolo
```

This will:
1. Deploy your Worker initially
2. Watch for file changes
3. Automatically redeploy on save
4. Show condensed deployment output with URLs

### Verbose Output
```bash
wrongler deploy --yolo --verbose
```

Shows full deployment output instead of condensed mode.

### With Environment
```bash
wrongler deploy --yolo --env production
```

### With Custom Entry Point
```bash
wrongler deploy src/worker.ts --yolo
```

### With Custom Worker Name
```bash
wrongler deploy --yolo --name my-worker
```

All standard Wrangler deploy flags work with YOLO mode!

### Example Output

```
🚀 YOLO Mode activated - watching for changes...

## Regular Wrangler Commands

Wrongler is a drop-in replacement for Wrangler. All commands work exactly the same:

```bash
wrongler dev
wrongler deploy
wrongler tail
wrongler kv:key put
# ... all other wrangler commands
```

## Why "Wrongler"?

Because adding auto-deploy on save is either brilliantly right or hilariously wrong depending on your perspective. It's called WRONG-ler because:

- Every file save triggers a deployment (what could go wrong? 😅)
- No confirmation, no safety nets, just pure deployment chaos
- It's the tool equivalent of "hold my beer and watch this"

**Use YOLO deploy solely for fun and at your own risk.** YOLO! 🎉

## Differences from Wrangler

Wrongler adds the `--yolo` flag to the `deploy` command for automatic redeployment on file changes. All other commands work exactly the same as wrangler.

## Development

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gryczka/wrongler.git
cd wrongler

```

### Testing Locally
```bash
# Link globally
npm link

# Test in a Worker project
cd /path/to/your/worker
wrongler deploy
```

### Building
```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test   # builds, then runs the node:test suite in test/
```
